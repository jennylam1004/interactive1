    <h1>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power,
    and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object,
    devoid of intelligence or agency.</strong> <em>But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently:
    It is more empowering.</em> <strong>When a powerful website — say Google or Facebook — gazes at, or links to,
    another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — it brings it into existence; gives it life.</strong>
    <em>Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe.</em>
    <strong>No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it,
    it is actually both dead and blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.</strong>

    <br />
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them.</em>
    <strong>Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time,
    web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.</em>

    <br />
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>But apps like Instagram are blind — or almost blind.</strong> <em>Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards,
    reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths.</em>
    <strong>The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</strong>

    <br />
    <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Even before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.</em>
    <strong>Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated,
    values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities.</strong>
    <em>That philosophy is the Stream.</em></h1>
