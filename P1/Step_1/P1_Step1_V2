    <h1>
      <Strong> MORE OR LESS,</Strong>
    </h1>
    <h2>
    <br /><Strong>ALL</Strong> <em>theorists</em> have thought of gaze in relation to <Strong>POWER</Strong>,
</h2>
    <br />and <Strong>MOSTLY</Strong> in a <Strong><em>negative</em></Strong> sense:
    <br />the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a <Strong><em>powerless</em></Strong> object,
    <br />
  <h2><em>devoid of intelligence or agency.</em></h2>
    <br />But in the world of webpages,
    <br />gaze functions differently:
    <br />It is more empowering.
    <br />When a <h2>POWERFUL</h2>website 
    <br />— say Google or Facebook — 
    <br />gazes at,
    <br />or links to,
    <br />another webpage,
    <br />it doesn’t just connect it 
    <br />— it brings it into <h2>EXISTANCE;
    <br /><em>gives it life.</em></h2>
    <br />Metaphorically,
    <br />without this <h2>empowering</h2> gaze,
    <br />your web page doesn’t breathe.
    <br />No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage,
    <br />unless somebody is looking at it,
    <br />it is actually both <h2>dead and blind;</h2>
    <br />and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.
    <br />On the other hand,
    <h2><br />the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them.</h2>
    <br />Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time,
    <br />web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.
    <br />But apps like Instagram are <Strong>BLIND</Strong>
    <br />— or almost blind.
    <br />Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards,
    <br />reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others,
    <h2><br />leading them into quiet deaths.</h2>
    <h1><br />The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</h1>
    <br />Even before I went to jail,
    <br />though,
    <br />the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.
    <br />Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most <h3>DOMINANT,</h3>
    <br />and most <h3>OVERATED,</h3>
    <br />values of our times:
    <br />novelty and popularity,
    <br />reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities.
    <h1><br />That philosophy is the Stream.</h1>
