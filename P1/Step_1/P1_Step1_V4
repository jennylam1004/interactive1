    <br /> <h1>More or less,</h1>
    <br /> <h2>all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power,</h2>
    <br /> <h3>and mostly in a negative sense:</h3>
    <br /> <h4>the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object,</h4>
    <br /> <h5>devoid of intelligence or agency.</h5>
    <br /> <h6>But in the world of webpages,</h6>
    <br /> <h1>gaze functions differently:</h1>
    <br /> <h2>It is more empowering.</h2>
    <br /> <h3>When a powerful website </h3>
    <br /> <h4>— say Google or Facebook — </h4>
    <br /> <h5>gazes at,</h5>
    <br /> <h6>or links to,</h6>
    <br /> <h1>another webpage,</h1>
    <br /> <h2>it doesn’t just connect it — </h2>
    <br /> <h3>it brings it into existence;</h3>
    <br /> <h4>gives it life.</h4>
    <br /> <h5>Metaphorically,</h5>
    <br /> <h6>without this empowering gaze,</h6>
    <br /> <h1>your web page doesn’t breathe.</h1>
    <br /> <h2>No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage,</h2>
    <br /> <h3>unless somebody is looking at it,</h3>
    <br /> <h4>it is actually both dead and blind;</h4>
    <br /> <h5>and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.</h5>


    <br /> <h6>On the other hand,</h6>
    <br /> <h1>the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them.</h1>
    <br /> <h2>Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time,</h2>
    <br /> <h3>web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.</h3>

    <br /> <h4>But apps like Instagram are blind</h4>
    <br /> <h5>— or almost blind.</h5>
    <br /> <h6>Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards,</h6>
    <br /> <h1>reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others,</h1>
    <br /> <h2>leading them into quiet deaths.</h2>
    <br /> <h3>The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</h3>


    <br /> <h4>Even before I went to jail,</h4>
    <br /> <h5>though,</h5>
    <br /> <h6>the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.</h6>
    <br /> <h1>Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant,</h1>
    <br /> <h2>and most overrated,</h2>
    <br /> <h3>values of our times:</h3>
    <br /> <h4>novelty and popularity,</h4>
    <br /> <h5>reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities.</h5>
    <br /> <h6>That philosophy is the Stream.</h6>
