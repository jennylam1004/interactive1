    <div id="var5">More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power, </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6"> and mostly in a negative sense:</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object,</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">devoid of intelligence or agency.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently:</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">It is more empowering.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">When a powerful website — say Google or Facebook — gazes at, or links to,</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — it brings it into existence; gives it life.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it,</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">it is actually both dead and blind;</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.</div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div id="var5">  On the other hand, </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them. </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time,</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.</div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div id="var6">But apps like Instagram are blind — or almost blind. </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards,</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">leading them into quiet deaths.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</div>
    <br />
    <br />
    <div id="var5">Even before I went to jail, though, </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">and most overrated,</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">values of our times: </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var7">novelty and popularity, </div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var5">reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities.</div>
    <br /> <br />
    <div id="var6">That philosophy is the Stream.</div>
