More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power,
and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object,
devoid of intelligence or agency. But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently:
It is more empowering. When a powerful website — say Google or Facebook — gazes at, or links to,
another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — it brings it into existence; gives it life.
Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe.
No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it,
it is actually both dead and blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.
