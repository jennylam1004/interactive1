    <p class="rotation5">More or less, all theorists have thought of gaze in relation to power,
    and mostly in a negative sense: the gazer strips the gazed and turns her into a powerless object,
    devoid of intelligence or agency.</p>
    <p class="rotation6">But in the world of webpages, gaze functions differently:It is more empowering.</p>
    <p class="rotation7">When a powerful website — say Google or Facebook — gazes at, or links to,
    another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it — it brings it into existence; gives it life.</p>
    <p class="rotation8">Metaphorically, without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe.</p>
    <p class="rotation9">No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind; and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.
    <br />
    <p class="rotation10">On the other hand, the most powerful web pages are those that have many eyes upon them.</p>
    <p class="rotation11">Just like celebrities who draw a kind of power from the millions of human eyes gazing at them any given time,
    web pages can capture and distribute their power through hyperlinks.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="rotation12">But apps like Instagram are blind — or almost blind. Their gaze goes nowhere except inwards,
    reluctant to transfer any of their vast powers to others, leading them into quiet deaths.</p>
    <p class="rotation13">The consequence is that web pages outside social media are dying.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="rotation14">Even before I went to jail, though, the power of hyperlinks was being curbed.</p>
    <p class="rotation15">Its biggest enemy was a philosophy that combined two of the most dominant, and most overrated, values of our times: novelty and popularity, reflected by the real world dominance of young celebrities.</p>
    <p class="rotation16">That philosophy is the Stream.</p>
